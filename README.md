* Notes *
Much more is required to full build this tree. I have made extensive changes to the AOSP code base and Find 5 kernel (you can use my Find 5 Kernel source). 
This build is based on my own build of CM 10.1. I built CM 10.1 device tree from ground up as no CM version existed at the time. Therefore, our trees will vary from one another.
